# Tic-Tac-Toe Game (JavaScript)

This project was a great way to strengthen my understanding of core JavaScript concepts, including:

- ✅ **Arrays** – to store the winning patterns
- ✅ **Boolean logic** – to switch turns between players
- ✅ **Event listeners** – to handle user interactions
- ✅ **forEach loop** – to iterate over buttons efficiently
- ✅ **Arrow functions** – for cleaner and more concise code
- ✅ **Enable/Disable buttons** – to prevent multiple clicks on the same box
- ✅ **CSS Hover Effects** – to enhance user experience

## How to Play:
- Two players take turns to click on the game grid.
- The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
- The game automatically detects a winner or a tie.

## How to Run the Game:
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ashabakshi/Tic-Tac-Toe-Javascript.git
    ```
2. Open the project in your browser by simply opening the `index.html` file.

Enjoy the game!
